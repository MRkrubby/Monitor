# Monitor QGIS Plugin

This repository already contains the packaged ZIP that QGIS can install directly.  You can find it in the repository root next to this README:

```
qgis_monitor_pro_3_3_13_logsafe.zip
```

To install the plugin:

1. Open QGIS and go to **Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins…**
2. Click **Install from ZIP**.
3. Browse to the ZIP listed above and confirm the installation.

If you ever need to verify that you are looking at the repository root, run `pwd` (print working directory) after navigating into the project directory.  For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/Monitor
pwd
```

The command will return the absolute path to the plugin root, which is where the ZIP and this README live.
